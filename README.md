# nhc_forecast_data
A python script to scrape the forecast advisories from the NHC website (https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2018/).

Data located in /data/

Currently only contains data for 2018. Forecast advisories are stored in raw text. They will have to be cleaned and coverted for use. NHC has data from 1998, the script could gather it but I chose to avoid spamming the NHC site for now.

Project uses virtualenv, to activate:
